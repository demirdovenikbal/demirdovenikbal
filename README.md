"Greetings Earthlings! I'm Ikbal and I come in peace as a software engineer, specializing in iOS development. With years of experience under my belt, I have superpowers in Swift. You can find here various projects that I've worked on, from tiny utility apps that can save your life in the case of an alien invasion, to huge enterprise applications that will make sure your toaster is always perfectly toasted. So take a look around, stay awhile, and don't be afraid to drop a star or fork if you find anything you like. Thanks for stopping by!"
