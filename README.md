# "Hello there! My name is Ikbal.

I am a Jedi software engineer, specializing in iOS development. With years of experience in the field, I have a mastery of Swift, and have been known to use the force to debug my code. On my GitHub, you will find a collection of my personal projects, contributions to open-source projects, and any other relevant code I have written. Just like the Jedi code, it's all about balance - so expect some clean, elegant code and some WIP (work in progress) that's a bit rough around the edges. Thanks for visiting!"
